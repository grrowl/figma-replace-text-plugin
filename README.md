# Bullet Replace Text

[View in Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1175987205049540503/Bullet-Replace-Text)

Really simply takes text from one element, splits it by lines, and replaces text in multiple other elements.

This scratches my own itch: I didn't want to fiddle with dialogs or reformat text. I have a big chunk of lines of text that I want shoved into a bunch of elements. This does that quickly and reliably.

Funnily enough I published this under my old work email so it's unlikely to get any minor updates on Figma Community.
